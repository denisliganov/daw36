  /**

  This class determines the locations of poles and zeros in the s-plane for a continuous time, 
  unit cutoff lowpass or low-shelving prototype filter. It supports Butterworth, Chebychev, inverse 
  Chebychev, elliptic and Bessel designs. Bessel design is provided only for the lowpass case via 
  a hard-coded table for filters for orders up to 25. That means, Bessel filters can be designed 
  only up to order 25 (which should be more than enough for all practical purposes). The remaining 
  4 design methods are based on calculation and have no restrictions (other than numerical 
  considerations) on the order, therefore. The low-shelving design is a generalization of a unit
  cutoff lowpass filter and and its magnitude response can be seen as the lowpass-response raised 
  to a pedestal. The height of this pedestal is called the reference gain (which is zero in the 
  lowpass-case). The gain the 'passband' (represented by the member variable G) is either a boost 
  (when G > 1) or an attenuation/cut (when G < 1) - for standard lowpass designs, this gain would 
  be unity.

  \todo
   -check the gain calculation 
   -solve the degree quation for other values than the filter order
   -check getFilterResponseAt() - seems to be buggy
   -rescale Bessel-poles so as to have the -3 dB point at unit cutoff (needs getFilterResponseAt)
